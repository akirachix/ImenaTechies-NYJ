                <h1>Social Relevance</h1>
                <p>"Born a Crime" is relevant because it talks about race, identity, 
                and belonging. Noah's story shows how complicated race
                 is in South Africa and how apartheid still affects society.
                  This is important today because many countries are dealing with
                   racism, discrimination, and inequality. Noah's story reminds us
                    how important it is to understand each other.

                    <h2>Economic Relevance</h2>
                    <p>"Born a Crime" talks about poverty and opportunity. Noah grew up poor
                    which shows the bigger problem of economic differences and access to resources.
                     His journey from poverty to success shows how education and hard work matter. This
                      is still important in today's discussions about economic power and help for everyone."
